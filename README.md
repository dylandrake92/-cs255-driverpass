# -cs255-driverpass
DriverPass Project Summary
The client, DriverPass, wanted a cloud-based system to help students prepare for their driving tests. The system needed to allow users to schedule driving lessons, take online practice tests, track progress, and manage accounts, while supporting different roles like students, instructors, and administrators.

What I Did Well
I clearly captured the client’s requirements and translated them into accurate UML diagrams and technical specifications. My design reflected the client’s processes without unnecessary complexity.

What I Would Revise
If I could revise one part, I would refine the class diagram by adding more detailed attributes and method stubs. This would make it more useful for developers during implementation.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
I mapped each client request from the interview to a specific system feature or process in the design. Considering user needs is critical because it ensures the final product aligns with real-world workflows and expectations, increasing adoption and satisfaction.

Approach to Designing Software
I start by gathering and clarifying requirements, then break them down into functional and nonfunctional needs. I use UML diagrams to visualize processes and relationships before defining technical requirements. In the future, I will continue using this structured approach, incorporating more user feedback early to improve accuracy.
